## Optimizations
This project originally only had one instrument - the drums. However, in an effort ot better understand and utilize data attributes. I created a system to switch between the instrumentsand their sounds depending on the slide of the carousel.

## Lessons Learned
I learned how th e system registers keycodes and how to effectively use data attributes. My next goal is to make this project OOP.
